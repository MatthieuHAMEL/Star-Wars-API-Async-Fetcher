# Star-Wars-API-Async-Fetcher
Learning about asyncio in Python!

I followed this tutorial, in french, from Nohar, it is really great : 
https://zestedesavoir.com/articles/1568/decouvrons-la-programmation-asynchrone-en-python/

star_wars.py is a basic sample to practice with aiohttp and to understand how to setup 
an asynchronous HTTP flow in Python.

I used the https://swapi.dev/ REST API.
